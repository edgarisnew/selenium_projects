This project envolves learning everything I can about utilizing Selenium (Python).

The main areas I hope to tackle are:

- Automation Testing of most website features (Sign up, login, password change, buttons, filters..etc)
- Elaborate test and bug reports from the automated tests
- Evolve into utilizing POM in all my scripts and make them easily readable, customizable and stackable. 
- Making useful and fun programs to entertain myself.

Most of these projects will be, by nature, extremely simple and beginner level for now, hopefuly that'll change in a near future.
