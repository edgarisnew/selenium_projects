This project envolves learning everything I can about utilising Selenium (Python).

The main areas I hope to tackle are:

- Automation Testing of most website features (Sign up, login, password change, buttons, filters..etc)
- Testing the security and perfomance of websites (Bot voting, "contact us" spamming, force breaching)
- Making useful and fun programs to entertain myself.

Most of these projects will be, by nature, extremely simple and beginner level for now, hopefuly that'll change in a near future.
